# Enumerable
This project is all about creating custom methods for enumerable module which have similar functionality to in-built one. This is second project of the Microverse program. I have also created a RSpec test folder to check function of those method. I used both negative and positive test cases for each method. It gave ample oppertinity to learn about Test Driven Development (TDD).
